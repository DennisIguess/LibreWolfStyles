# LibreWolf Styles

This repo contains a collection of themes to customize LibreWolf / Firefox using the ```userChrome.css``` feature.

Some are created by me, others are taken from other repos (credits in the themes ```README.md```.


## Installation

I wrote the bash script ```changeCSS.sh```, that automatically pulls the themes from this repo and changes the currently applied theme.
Just fill in the path variables to fit your system.

The available themes are checked from a local repo though, that was the easiest way to check if a theme is in the repo, as I keep my local repo up to date with remote anyway.
